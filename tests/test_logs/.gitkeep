# Test Logs Directory

This directory contains test execution logs and summaries.

## Log Files

- `{testscript_name}_{timestamp}.log` - Individual test failure logs
- `test_summary_{timestamp}.txt` - Master test execution summaries

## Retention Policy

- Logs are kept for debugging failed tests
- Clean up logs older than 30 days to save space
- Use `./cleanup_test_logs.sh` to remove old logs

## Log Format

### Individual Test Logs
Each failed test creates a log file with:
- Test name and timestamp
- Error messages and stack traces
- Environment information
- Failed assertions

### Summary Logs
Master test execution creates summary files with:
- Total tests run
- Pass/fail counts by category
- Execution time
- Failed test list
- Coverage statistics
